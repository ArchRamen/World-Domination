# The Gifts of Imperfection

## Notes

### A. Preface 
- Discomfort around this lady "telling" me things
    - Tone too juvenile? Condescending? Does understanding and compassion register to me as "babying"/weak? Sexist?
- Spoke about race - **_irritated me_**
    - why?
        - victim posturing? Complaining? **weakness**?
- "How much we know and understand ourselves is critically important but there is something more essential to living a whole-hearted life: loving ourselves. **knowledge is important but only if we are being kind and gentle with ourselves as we work to figure out who we are.** Whole-heartedness is as much about embracing our tenderness and vulnerability as it is about developing knowledge and claiming power."
    - Voila. I'm unbalanced. I hypervalue knowledge and power to the point of obsession and am void of gentleness and kindness and compassion for myself. Only status and influence will do- nothing else matters.
        - this sentiment is hyper-masculinity. *rid yourself of compassion, feeling, empathy, and self-understanding. chase power/status and self medicate with external validation, pleasure, and self-deception/denial **("I am not in pain. I am not lonely. I am not broken. I do not feel unlovable. I am not anxious. I do not feel unworthy")**
        - **Hyper masculinity is the prioritization of the masculine ideal over wholeness, over your own humanity.** 
        - Is this why women are so much stronger/adaptable/versatile/resilient than men today? Because men are taught that their denial of self-understanding, of being, is noble?
    - Women aren't necessarily stronger... they don't have to be.  Because they are able to look at themselves honestly, they can better diagnose AND reach out for help. It doesnt even come to the issue of strength/weakness. It's efficiency.
- "**We cannot give our children what we do not have.** Where we are on our own journey of living and loving with our whole hearts is a much stronger indicator of parenting success than anything we can learn from how-to books"
