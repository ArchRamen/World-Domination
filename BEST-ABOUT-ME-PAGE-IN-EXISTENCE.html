        <h1>origin story</h1>
        <p>I summoned myself into existence from Nothingness on the 6th of August, one thousand nine
            hundred and two years after that one guy got glocked on the cross.
            Actively striving to beat his high score.

        <h2>Favorite Hobbies?</h2>
        <p>The feeling when you crush someone's desire to oppose you-> I am forever chasing
            that high. Currently, it's in video games like League of Legends and Apex Legends.
            Soon, it'll be in some sort of physical contest. I like breaking past my own limits
            and helping others do the same. Reading is dank, too. OOOOH and nature is fucking
            crispy. Have you ever looked at a tree? Like REALLY looked at it? MY GOD BRO. ELITE
            ENGINEERING.

        <h1>Dream Job?</h1>
        <p>I'd like to show people at scale how powerful and intelligent and boundless they are.
            Something like "Global authority on surpassing self-imposed limits, both external and internal" or
            "Executive Limit Buster" or "Prophet of the Way of the Kryptonians"

        <h1>Why are you learning the dark arts of coding?</h1>
        <p>BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ALCHEMY. YOU PUT THESE SPECIFIC RUNES TOGETHER IN A SPECIFIC SEQUENCE AND THEN
            ABRAKADABRA WAKAMAZOO- A THING HAPPENS. A THING YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN. LIKE YOU DID THAT
            THING THAT JUST HAPPENED. YOURE A GODDAMN WIZARD HARRY.
