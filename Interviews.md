# What You Don't Understand About Job Interviews - HealthyGamerGG

## Notes

### I. Social Anxiety 
- People go to interview --> Anxiety
- Anxiety go: "im socially anxious! omg! i cant speak in front of people! Im gonna' look stoopid!"
- Anxiety cont': "what if i look like an idiot? remember the structure of the speech! dont forget the bullet points! what if they judge how i look, talk? WHat if they dont like me at all? WHAT IF THEY REJECT ALL THAT I AM AND ALL THAT I STAND FOR?"
- **The mind is chiefly concerned with the fear of being judged, not the speech itself**
    - negative effect on performance

### II. "I Have Something To Offer"
- You have been ***invited*** to give a speech and add value according to your own ***unique*** perspective from your own ***unique*** experience.
    - AKA They want to hear what you have to say because it is **VALUABLE**
- The role of the audience is **not** to judge you
- ***This is an opportunity to share and enrich the lives of those listening to you***
    - No one is omnicient, no matter their qualifications
    - The potential for people to benefit from what you have to share always exists.
- You are there to **give** to them, they are not there for you. You're the one gifting something valuable.
- **You are there to share a piece of what you understand and enrich their lives. *I AM HERE OUT OF SERVICE***
- It's not about whether im good, or if they like me, or if they clap at the end, or if they think im smart.

### III. Interview Magic
- Scenario:
    - Company is looking for someone to do a job for them
    - Ideally, their looking for someone good because they want to do a good job.
- You are not there to get the job
- Forget about how badly you want the job, how significant it is for you, etc.
- When you walk into the interview, realize that you could be the savior capable of meeting the company's needs.
    - Again, you have something to offer.
    - Go in and genuinely advocate your skillset and abilities **with a spirit of service** and let the company itself worry about whether or not they want to hire you.
        - "it's up to you to decide whether or not I'm a good fit."
- **Let go of the idea of you being judged**
    - "Am i gonna get the job? Am i not gonna get the job? Are they gonna like it? Are they not gonna like it? Am i screwing up? Am i not screwing up?"
    - ITS ALL ABOUT ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME
    - If you consumed with thoughts about yourself aka how youre being perceived while you're giving a speech/interview --> you will be empathically disconnected with your audience --> Lowers the quality of the interaction/speech.
    - You arent there to convince them of something
    - Youre there to offer something and try to help.
- If they dont want you/ youre not helpful, so be it. That could happen from time to time. And thats ok!
- Do not give in to the pressure to upsell or mask yourself: **just be authentic** 
    - "This is what im good at, this is what I can do for you. You tell me whether that's something you want, or don't want."
- **The more you orient yourself towards authentic service, the more powerful you will be.**
    - *some companies/people may try and take advantage of this. keep your eyes and ears open.

### I N C A N T A T I O N S (or exercises)
- Look at your resume/CV
- BEHOLD: YOUR SPLENDOR
- Go in front of mirror
- BEHOLD: MORE SPLENDOR
- Recognize that you are the person that may be able to help this company immensely
- Recognize that you are not the person that is to judge yourself unfit or fit for the job
- Recognize that the interview is for you to ***showcase who you are*** and ***that who you are is a cosmic event the likes of which the universe has never seen nor will ever see again***
